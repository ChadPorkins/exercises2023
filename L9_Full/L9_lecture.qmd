This week we will research data from the AirQualityUCI.csv

The dataset contains 827 instances of hourly averaged responses from an
array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality
Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a
significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city.

Attribute Information:

1.  Date (DD/MM/YYYY)

2.  Time (HH.MM.SS)

3.  Hourly averaged concentration CO in mg/m\^3

4.  Hourly averaged overall Non Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in
    microg/m\^3

5.  Hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m\^3

6.  Hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb

7.  Hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m\^3

8.  Temperature in CÂ°

9.  Relative Humidity (%)

10. Absolute Humidity

## Question 1

-   Read AirQualityUCI.csv into R

-   As always the first we need to do is to check our data! use the
    summary `function` to review all variables and look for NAs and
    outliers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your favorite professor hinted to you that some pollutants are
correlated. Plotting two variables against each other is a great tool to
check their relation. (Feel free to add different colors, sizes, titles, and trend lines, for the trend line you can use `abline(lm(x~y, data =))`)

-   Use plot `(x~y, data =)` on the following columns and examine the results:

1.  CO vs. Benzene

2.  NMHC VS. RH

3.  CO vs. NOx

4.  Temp vs. Nox

5.  Temp vs. RH

## Question 2

Plotting is a great tool, however, for a better and more accurate
result, we will use a correlation analysis test.

We saw earlier that CO-Benzene relation is high and CO-NOx is high as
well.

-   Check if the attribute above are normally distributed.

-   Perform correlation tests on CO-Benzene and CO-NOx with the
    right method and answer the question - which relation is stronger?

## Question 3

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that is slightly less dense than air and
consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
is one of several nitrogen oxides and is considered an air pollutant
created mostly by internal combustion engines (for example car engines).
Your mission is to explain NO2 only with CO, meaning that you should run
a simple linear regression model with NO2 being the outcome variable. In
other words, you want to use CO to predict NO2. Before doing so,
remember that the outcome variable should be normally distributed,

-   Check if the outcome variable (NO2) is normaly distributed.

-   Check for linearity between the attributes.

-   Check for multicollinearity (Independence of observations).

-   Run simple linear regression model as you explain NO2 with CO.

-   Check for Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance).


## Question 4

This time the goal of the model is to establish the relationship between
"NO2" as a response variable with "CO", "Benzene", "NOx", "Temp" and
"RH" as predictor variables.

-   Check for linearity between the attributes.

-   Check for multicollinearity (Independence of observations).

-   Run Multiple Linear Regression to check the relationship between No2
    and the other variables.

-   Check for Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance).
